The QR MENU Project that I've created is looking good with its perfect design.

The Menu is divided into four parts. It has "All", "Breakfast", "Lunch" and "Shakes" categories. (Buttons). Each category has an average of 3 or 5 foods or drinks. You can discover foods and drinks with different prices. Read the details clearly! When you click on the picture, another page opens and you can only see that food or drink in that page.
